          Malcolm X was one of the most dynamic, dramatic and influential
          figures of the civil rights era. He was an apostle of black
          nationalism, self respect, and uncompromising resistance to white
          oppression. Malcolm X was a polarizing figure who both energized and
          divided African Americans, while frightening and alienating many
          whites. He was an unrelenting truth-teller who declared that the
          mainstream civil rights movement was naïve in hoping to secure freedom
          through integration and nonviolence. The blazing heat of Malcolm X's
          rhetoric sometimes overshadowed the complexity of his message,
          especially for those who found him threatening in the first place.
          Malcolm X was assassinated at age 39, but his political and cultural
          influence grew far greater in the years after his death than when he
          was alive. Malcolm X is now popularly seen as one of the two great
          martyrs of the 20th century black freedom struggle, the other being
          his ostensible rival, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. But in the
          spring of 1964, when Malcolm X gave his "Ballot or the Bullet" speech,
          he was regarded by a majority of white Americans as a menacing
          character. Malcolm X never directly called for violent revolution, but
          he warned that African Americans would use "any means necessary" –
          especially armed self defense – once they realized just how pervasive
          and hopelessly entrenched white racism had become.

          He was born Malcolm Little in 1925 in Omaha, Nebraska. His father,
          Earl, was a Baptist preacher and follower of the black nationalist
          Marcus Garvey. Earl Little's political activism provoked threats from
          the Ku Klux Klan. After the family moved to Lansing, Michigan, white
          terrorists burned the Littles' home. A defiant Earl Little shot at the
          arsonists as they got away. In 1931, Malcolm's father was found dead.
          His family suspected he'd been murdered by white vigilantes. Malcolm's
          mother, Louise, battled mental illness and struggled to care for her
          eight children during the Great Depression. She was committed to a
          state mental institution when Malcolm was 12. He and the other young
          children were scattered among foster families. After completing the
          eighth grade, Malcolm Little dropped out when a teacher told him that
          his dream of becoming a lawyer was unrealistic for a "nigger."2 As a
          teenager, Malcolm Little made his way to New York, where he took the
          street name Detroit Red and became a pimp and petty criminal. In 1946,
          Malcolm Little was sent to prison for burglary. He read voraciously
          while serving time and converted to the Black Muslim faith. He joined
          the Nation of Islam (NOI) and changed his name to Malcolm X,
          eliminating that part of his identity he called a white-imposed slave
          name.

          Malcom X was released in 1952 after six years in prison. With his
          charisma and eloquence, Malcolm rose rapidly in the Nation of Islam.
          He became the chief spokesman and field recruiter for NOI leader
          Elijah Muhammad. As historian Peniel Joseph describes it, NOI's
          unorthodox interpretation of Islam was mixed with a doctrine of black
          personal responsibility and economic self-sufficiency, along with
          "theological fundamentalism, anti-white mythology, and total racial
          separation as the means to black redemption."3 Wearing impeccable
          suits, maintaining an air of fierce dignity and adhering to a strict
          code of moral propriety, Malcolm X was a living demonstration of how
          the NOI could save a wayward people from racial submission and
          personal self-destruction. The Nation dismissed the conventional civil
          rights movement – with its protest marches and demands for equal
          rights legislation -- as impotent and misguided. As Malcolm X declared
          in this speech, the only effective solution to racial inequality was
          black economic and social separatism. As Malcolm X's national
          prominence grew, so did a rift between him and Elijah Muhammad.
          Malcolm X far overshadowed his mentor in the public sphere. He also
          grew disillusioned by Elijah Muhammad's scandalous personal behavior;
          the Messenger fathered several children through affairs with his
          secretaries.

          Finally, in March 1964, Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam and charted
          his own course of militant, black nationalism. On April 12, 1964, one
          month after splitting with the NOI, Malcolm X gave his "Ballot or the
          Bullet" speech at King Solomon Baptist Church in Detroit (he'd given
          the address nine days earlier in Cleveland, but the Detroit version is
          regarded by some scholars as definitive).5 It was the fullest
          declaration of his black nationalist philosophy. Mainstream black
          ministers in Detroit tried to block Malcolm X from using the church,
          saying "separatist ideas can do nothing but set back the colored man's
          cause." But the church hall had already been rented out for the event.
          The conflict deepened when Muhammad suspended Malcolm X for saying
          that President John F. Kennedy's assassination represented "the
          chickens coming home to roost" because of the war in Vietnam. Finally,
          in March 1964, Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam and charted his own
          course of militant, black nationalism. On April 12, 1964, one month
          after splitting with the NOI, Malcolm X gave his "Ballot or the
          Bullet" speech at King Solomon Baptist Church in Detroit (he'd given
          the address nine days earlier in Cleveland, but the Detroit version is
          regarded by some scholars as definitive).5 It was the fullest
          declaration of his black nationalist philosophy.

          the colored man's cause." But the church hall had already been rented
          out for the event."The Ballot or the Bullet" became one of Malcolm X's
          most recognizable phrases, and the speech was one of his greatest
          orations. Two thousand people – including some of his opponents --
          turned out to hear him speak in Detroit.. President Lyndon Johnson was
          running for reelection in 1964, and Malcolm X declared it "the year of
          the ballot or the bullet." He outlined a new, global sensibility in
          the fight for racial justice: "We intend to expand [the freedom
          struggle] from the level of civil rights to the level of human
          rights." Malcolm was now free of the NOI's ban on members
          participating in the mainstream civil rights movement. He encouraged
          black militants to get involved in voter registration drives and other
          forms of community organizing to redefine and expand the movement. The
          day after his Detroit speech, Malcolm X embarked on an overseas tour
          that included a life-changing pilgrimage to the Muslim holy city of
          Mecca. Known as the Hajj, the pilgrimage must be carried out at least
          once in a lifetime by every able-bodied Muslim who can afford to do
          so.
